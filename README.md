# Website_work
This is my personal website code.

## About
A small skeleton biography website is included in the `css/` folder. It provides a minimal, responsive starting point for:

- An About page with a short bio and a link to your GitHub profile
- An Education page listing degrees, certifications, and coursework
- A simple Contact section in the footer with an email link

The files added are:

- `css/index.html` — main About page
- `css/education.html` — Education page
- `css/styles.css` — shared styles for the site

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS (responsive, minimal styles)

## View locally
Open `css/index.html` in your browser. On Windows you can double-click the file, or open it from the command line:

```powershell
start .\\css\\index.html
```

Replace placeholder text (name, GitHub username, email, education details) with your real information.

If you'd like, I can add more pages, a navigation highlight, or host this on GitHub Pages.
